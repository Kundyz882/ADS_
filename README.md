**Main**

    1. Run this file to start the program.

    2. The program will prompt you to enter values for different problems sequentially.

    3. Each problem corresponds to a function that solves a specific computational task.

    4. Enter the required arguments when prompted.

    5. Get the result for each problem displayed in the console.

**Functions**


    1. Minimum of an Array: 

    Returns the smallest number in the given array.

    2. Average of an Array:

    Returns the average value of all elements in the array.

    3. Prime Number Check:

    Checks whether a given number n is prime.

    4. Factorial (Recursive):
    
    Finds the factorial of n using recursion.
    
    5. Fibonacci Sequence (Recursive):
    
    Finds the n-th element in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
    
    6. Power Calculation:
    
    Computes a^n (a raised to the power of n) using recursion.
    
    7. Reverse Array (Recursive, No Array Data Structure):
    
    Reverses the given array using recursion without using an array data structure.
    
    8. Check if String Consists of Digits:
    
    Determines whether a given string consists only of digits.
    
    9. Binomial Coefficient (Recursive):
    
    Finds the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the recursive formula:
    
    C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)
    
    Base cases: C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1
    
    10. Greatest Common Divisor (Recursive):
    
    Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean Algorithm with recursion.
